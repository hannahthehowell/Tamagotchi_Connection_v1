## Description from the Tamagotchi Wiki

"The Tamagotchi Connection was the first Tamagotchi release to use Tamacom, an Infrared feature that connects two Tamagotchi pets, allowing them to play games, exchange presents, and give birth to offspring. It features characters from both version of the the classic Tamagotchi (1996) and the Mesutchi and Osutchi (1997), as well as several new characters.

"Its screen is larger but with smaller pixels, with a resolution of 32 x 30. It features an infrared port across the top of the shell, and the keychain hole is to the right.

"The Tamagotchi Connection has 10 icons, 2 more functions in addition to the 8 found in prior releases. The two newer functions added were Communication (i.e. fifth icon, shapped like a heart with radio waves) and Friends List (i.e. ninth icon, shaped like an open book). Additionally, the user must also input the current date and their birthday when setting it up for the first time. The user must also name their Tamagotchi when they're born, or when the next generation begins.

"Failing to tend to a Tamagotchi when it is hungry, sick or misbehaving impacts their physical health, and their emotional health is affected by how the user responds to their happiness, the lights when they are sleeping or when they are upset. Certain characters can only be gotten depending on whether their physical needs were tended to more than their emotional needs or vice versa."
